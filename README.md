Each person modifies their own branch and submits pull requests (PR) into the `main` branch. **Robin will handle all PR's**

When you start a new task

* `git checkout -b <branch name>` to start a new branch
* do the things, commit often, and push up to your branch on github often also
* When task complete, open a pull request from your branch to `main`. 
* After successful merge of your item back into the `main` branch, either do a pull request from `main` to your branch, or delete your branch and start a new one.
