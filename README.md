Each person modifies their own branch and submits pull requests (PR) into the `main` branch. **Robin will handle all PR's**

When you start a new task

* `git checkout -b <branch name>` to start a new branch
* do the things, commit often, and push up to your branch on github often also
* When task complete, open a pull request from your branch to `main`. 
* After successful merge of your item back into the `main` branch, either do a pull request from `main` to your branch, or delete your branch and start a new one.

Robins goals for this week: Revise Ch 1 and Hw 1.  
Sent ch1 notes in slack
Faith is messing around with chapter 1 notes sent in Slack --thinking learnr could create a nice page.
Might work to use checkr with learnr to allow students to check their code as they go 
Setting up the table of contents in learnr allows students to return to whatever section they were working on Learnr stuff
Set progressive field to true in the yaml header to reveal sections as students work so there aren’t any spoilers (from link above)

Still working on converting notes. I’m not sure how the exercises where students use the console and are seeing how objects are stored will work in learnR -- looking into this
Might work to just insert images
