# Section 4.3: Variance and Standard Deviation

Just like for discrete variables, the variance and the standard deviation measures the spread of the random variable around its mean. The formulas remain unchanged for the continuous random variable.

### Example
Find the variance of the random variable $Y$, where
\[
f_{Y}(y)=3(1-y)^{2},0<y<1
\]

### You try it
1. An exponential random variable has the following pdf: $f_{Y}(y)=\lambda e^{-\lambda y}$, $y\geq0$.  Show that the variance of $Y$ is $1/\lambda^{2}$.

2. A random variable $Y$ is described by the pdf $f_{Y}(y)=2y$ for $0\leq y\leq 1$. What is the standard deviation of $3Y+2$
